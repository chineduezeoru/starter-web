A new kind of violence known as “salad bar extremism” has come to Canada, warns an internal government report obtained by Global News.



The term refers to attacks fuelled by a mix of views rather than a coherent ideology, said the report, which cited the recent Edmonton city hall shooting.

“While some extremists are assessed to have a primary motivation, others are influenced by a combination of beliefs,” said the Strategic Threat Assessment.
